# Employee-Work-Performance
Employee Work performance measurement and tracking system

The “Employee Management System” is based on the salary activity for each company staff depending on their
attendance and the performance of employee. The first activity is based on saving the Projects details where each
Project will be given a unique Project ID. The Manager only has the authority to enter the number of leaves available
for leave type and for each Project. Now based on the no of days an Employee attended, salary will be calculated and a
separate salary slip will be provided for reference. Manager has the authority to add Project details. And he also has the
right to edit or delete Project information to/from the list. Manager provides a unique username and password for each
Employee through which he can login. All the information’s are being saved in the database. And we check the
deadline of project and depend on the work of employee grade will be assign. And cluster the Grade in high, medium,
low format using the KNN algorithm. This help to manager to assign the project and also if he wants to change the
team leader at that time also. So KNN algorithm save the time of manager.
